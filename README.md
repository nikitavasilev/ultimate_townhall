# Ultimate Scrapping App - Spammer

This work was done as a project for [The Hacking Project Bootcamp](https://www.thehackingproject.org/).
The goal was to work along with a team, learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and build an app that scrapps the data of a website. Then we convert that data to a JSON and CSV formats for beeing able to  used it for spamming or automatic following on twitter.

- `app.rb` is the exe file.
- `Gemfile` contains all the gems we used in this program. 
- `db` folder contains our database.
- `lib` contains two folders. First one is `app` which contains all our working files (scrapper, bot, mailer, etc) and `view` contains the files that executes each of these along with `app.rb`.

## Requirements
