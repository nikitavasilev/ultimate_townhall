# Ultimate Scrapping App - Email Spammer + Twitter Bot

This work was done as a project for [The Hacking Project Bootcamp](https://www.thehackingproject.org/).
The goal was to work along with a team, learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and build an app that scrapps the data of a website. Then we convert to a JSON format and also CSV to used it for spamming or automatic following or likings on twitter.

- `Gemfile` contains all the gems we used in this program. 
- `db` folder contains our database.
- `lib` contains two folders. First one is `app` which contains all our working files (scrapper, bot, mailer, etc) and `view` contains the files that executes each of these along with `app.rb`.
- `app.rb` is the exe file.

## Requirements

You need at least ruby 4.5.1 (maybe under but not tested) and bundler installed on your computer.

1. First of all `git clone the repo`
2. Run `$ cd ultimate_townhall`
3. Run `$ bundle install`
4. Enjoy by executing the program `$ ruby app.rb`
